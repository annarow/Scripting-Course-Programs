This project was actually pretty difficult for me. I realized my python skills are very rudamentary and I struggled a lot
to make my code look my like a script then a python program. I tried to break up
programs into functions as much as I could as well as reuse functions.
There is still alot about fast coding in python I don't understand. The assignment was sort of
confusing but I asked classmates to clarify what was being asked and that helped.

CODE

-the program is run and calls the main function where it asks the user to input
first the text file with the baseline information. Next it prompts the user
for the second text file which is refered to as test, which includes
newer information and is compared to the baseline file.

-main is used to handle all calls to functions and with heavy use
of parameters and returns with two variables to differentiate
between calls to the function which compares segments and cookies.

-for loops are used in most functions to iterate over the data and create
dictionaries and lists of segments as keys and cookies as values,
a dictionary with cookies as keys and segments as values, a list 
of non-empty cookies and lists of empty cookies. These data sets were
used throughout the entire program.

-Printing out the report is done in two functions where the first function
creates a file to write to and the second function appends to the existing file.

I did really enjoy doing python it is a really fun language!
