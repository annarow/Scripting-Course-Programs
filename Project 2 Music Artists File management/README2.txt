For Assignment 2.

First Implementation: Using Perl
	-The files and directories for the music information used for this assignment is under the home directory named "MusicInfo"
	 which is kept in the same directory as the source code for the assignment. For this code to work the home directory
	 most be called "MusicInfo".
	-The source code which is used to extract the folders from the home directopry "MusicInfo" and pipes the code into 
	 another source code text file put into standard output as "report.out" is "Assignment2Main.txt". This source code
	 most be in the same directory as all other source code and "MusicInfo". To run the perl implementation run 
	 "Assignment2Main.txt".
	-The source code which does all the main work is "Assignment2.txt" and must be in the same directory as the main
	 source code and "MusicInfo" directory. The directory with all music information must be renamed to this.
	-The source code in "Assignment2.txt" uses perl to print out html format for the albums and songs for each artist.
	

Reflection

	Based on the examples done in class I was able to struggle my way through undertsanding the END and the for loop logic.
	I got really stuck on figuring out when an album was finished printing so I could print out the end of the html 
	formatting for the end of a table. I also could not for the life of me figure out how to run the perl script on just
	one source code text file. I only figured out how to run it on 2 different source codes using a pipe line into the 
	the second source code with all the real work. Honestly this class is definetly one of the hardest classes I've taken 
	along with maybe my first C++ class because of the googleing for all help aspect. And I'm not used to that yet.
